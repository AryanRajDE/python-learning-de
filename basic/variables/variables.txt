A variable is the name given to a memory location. A value-holding Python variable is also known as an Identifier.

-- Python Variable Types -- 
There are two types of variables in Python - Local variable and Global variable.

1. Local Variable: The variables that are declared within the function and have scope within the function are known as local variables. 

2. Global Variable: Global variables can be utilized all through the program, and its extension is in the whole program. 
                    Global variables can be used inside or outside the function. 
                    By default, a variable declared outside of the function serves as the global variable.
                    The function treats it as a local variable if we don't use the global keyword.
